# Let-the-games-begin
This week’s goal is to create a “Guess the number” game, using the terminal from Weekend Challenge 2. 

Now that you are introduced to Linux terminal, let’s make a couple of games that we can run and interact with.

The computer picks a random number from 1 to N where the player enters the N number on the terminal.
1.	Create a guess the number game in bash
2.	Create a guess the number game in C
3.	Create script that will run first the bash game and when guessed number = true, run C game then exit when player guesses this number

You can make it as fun as you want, don’t forget you can use different fonts for displaying (e.g. Toilet)

The winner of this week’s challenge will have an exclusive title on our Discord channel and will be announced on Tuesday by our expert and independent jury.
